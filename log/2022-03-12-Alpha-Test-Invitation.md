Hello Everyone,

I like VTuber. I believe it is an innovative, interesting, and interactive experience that drives imagination and ideas.

To create a more enjoyable experience, I believe everyone should have an avatar to create more interaction in the virtual world.

However, the barrier to become a VTuber is still high. One would need a decent computer with some basic software understanding to set things up.

As a MacBook user, some softwares just cannot run on my laptop with acceptable performance. The setup is painful, and the GPU is hard to be utilized. Finally, I decided to do something to change this.

With "OpenLive3D", I aim to remove the barrier. You can just open the website on your computer with a webcam, and the motion tracker will link to the virtual character directly.

The Website is now open for free Alpha test with no registration requirement. I would like to know your feedbacks and ideas.

Thank you and Have Fun!

Best Regards,
