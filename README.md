## Project Features

Current Virtual Avatar software often require expensive setup. For this project, our goals are:

 - Easy to Use
 - Less Hardware Requirement
 - Highly Customizable


## Engineering Features

The project aims to connect the half-body movement with facial landmarks to the 3D `VRM` avatar.

 - Facial landmark model based on `TF.js`
 - Adjustable config to map landmarks to the avatar
 - Modularized and flexible structure


## Project Status

Beta-1.2.X:
 - Ultra-Fast Mode with only Facial Landmark Model
